# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

The Movie Recommendation System is a web-based application that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical ratings. The system leverages collaborative filtering, genre-based recommendation, and recommendation by release year or decade algorithms to generate recommendations tailored to each user's tastes.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: The application offers an intuitive user interface developed using Streamlit, allowing users to input preferences and view recommendations easily.
  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: The recommendation algorithms analyze user ratings and movie metadata to suggest relevant and personalized movie recommendations.
  
- **Support for Multiple Recommendation Techniques**: The system supports collaborative filtering, genre-based recommendation, and recommendation by release year or decade, providing users with diverse options for discovering new movies.

## Architecture

The Movie Recommendation System follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: The user interface is developed using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. Users interact with the application through a web browser.
  
- **Backend**: Backend services handle data processing, model inference, and recommendation generation. These services are implemented using Python and rely on libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
  
- **Data Storage**: The system stores movie ratings, metadata, and precomputed similarity matrices in a database or file system.

## Functions

Certainly! Here's an elaboration on the functions used in your movie recommendation system:

### 1. `get_similar_items(movie_title, n=5)`

- **Description**: This function retrieves similar movies to a given movie based on item-item similarity scores calculated using cosine similarity.
  
- **Input**: 
  - `movie_title`: Title of the movie for which similar items are to be retrieved.
  - `n`: Number of similar items to retrieve (default is 5).

- **Output**: 
  - A list of `n` similar movies to the input movie.

### 2. `recommend_movies(user_id, n=5)`

- **Description**: This function generates movie recommendations for a given user using collaborative filtering. It calculates the similarity between the movies the user has rated and other movies, and recommends the top-rated similar movies.

- **Input**: 
  - `user_id`: ID of the user for whom recommendations are to be generated.
  - `n`: Number of recommendations to generate (default is 5).

- **Output**: 
  - A list of `n` recommended movies for the user.

### 3. `recommend_movies_by_genres(selected_genres, n=5)`

- **Description**: This function recommends movies based on selected genres. It filters movies that match at least one of the selected genres and then ranks them based on the number of matching genres.

- **Input**: 
  - `selected_genres`: List of genres selected by the user.
  - `n`: Number of recommendations to generate (default is 5).

- **Output**: 
  - A DataFrame containing `n` recommended movies with their IDs, titles, and genres.

### 4. `recommend_movies_by_release_year(year, n=5)`

- **Description**: This function recommends movies released in a specific year. It filters movies based on the release year and ranks them based on popularity (e.g., average rating).

- **Input**: 
  - `year`: The release year for which recommendations are to be generated.
  - `n`: Number of recommendations to generate (default is 5).

- **Output**: 
  - A DataFrame containing `n` recommended movies released in the specified year with their IDs, titles, and genres.

### 5. `recommend_movies_by_release_decade(decade, n=5)`

- **Description**: This function recommends movies released in a specific decade. It filters movies based on the release year falling within the specified decade and ranks them based on popularity (e.g., average rating).

- **Input**: 
  - `decade`: The start year of the decade for which recommendations are to be generated.
  - `n`: Number of recommendations to generate (default is 5).

- **Output**: 
  - A DataFrame containing `n` recommended movies released in the specified decade with their IDs, titles, and genres.

These functions collectively provide the core recommendation functionality of the movie recommendation system, enabling users to discover new movies tailored to their preferences.
